								<p class="p1">
									<strong>How does the Express Meetings service work?</strong>
									<br>
									The venuefinding service is free service to you, as an agency we are paid a commission by your chosen venue once your event is contracted and has taken place
									<br>
									<br>
									<strong>Do I have to choose the venue?</strong>
									<br>
									We would request that you pick a venue for us to approach, however if you do not know of any then we will find the perfect venue for your requirements and budget
									<br>
									<br>
									<strong>How long will the process take?</strong>
									<br>
									We aim to have provided you with a full proposal of a venue with costs within 2 hours of receiving the enquiry
									<br>
									<br>
									<strong>What happens if I don't like the venue offered or location?</strong>
									<br>
									Our team will contact you when the proposal is ready and talk you through the venue. Should you decide you're not happy with the venue then your enquiry will be moved to the normal venue finding process and we will then provide 3 suitable venues within a timeline agreed between both parties
									<br>
									<br>
									<strong>Are there any hidden costs?</strong>
									<br>
									There are no costs incurred by you for the venue finding service, once the venue is confirmed the venue will require payment details from you for your conference booking, all we ask if that the booking is fair and honest.
									<br>
									<br>
									<strong>Will I lose my contact with the hotel?</strong>
									<br>
									Not at all, we will purely do the initial booking and confirm the space. Once the booking is confirmed the venue will be in contact with you to arrange the final details and contract for your event
									<br>
									<br>
									<strong>Can you help with the contracts?</strong>
									<br>
									Yes we can help with checking the contracts and making sure that the terms and conditions are all in line with your event. We are not legal experts, however we do deal with many events and understand event contracts and cancellation charges.
									<br />

When I am not working I enjoy spending time with my boyfriend, socialising with my friends and family.
